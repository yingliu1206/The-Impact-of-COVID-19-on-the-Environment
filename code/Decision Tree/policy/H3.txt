Our Environmental Rule of Law report was the first such global assessment. It found that a lack of political will to fully implement and enforce environmental laws is one of the greatest challenges to mitigating climate change, reducing pollution, and preventing widespread species and habitat loss. Two months after its publication, the Supreme Court of India cited UNEP and the report in a ruling on a proposed airport that was to be constructed in an eco-sensitive area in the state of Goa. The decision judicially recognized the concept of environmental rule of law for the first time in India. 
Our Frontiers 2018/19 report on emerging environmental issues addressed the threat posed by nitrogen pollution. The report informed discussions at the United Nations Environment Assembly, and Member States subsequently adopted a resolution on nitrogen management that included a proviso to better coordinate policies across the nitrogen cycle at national, regional and global levels. 
Science does not just show us where we are. It shows us how to get to where we need to be. The UNEP-hosted International Resource Panel released a summary of its new report Resource Efficiency and Climate Change at the Madrid summit in December. The report shows how material efficiency strategies applied to cars and residential buildings could help countries further reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. G7 countries alone could save up to 170 million tonnes of carbon emissions from homes by 2050, compared to 2016 levels. In this same sector and period, China could save some 350 million tonnes and India some 270 million tonnes. All of this could happen through strategies and technologies that are available today.
