* Environmental problems have always been an issue that cannot be ignored in the development process of all countries. However, the mode of development at the expense of the environment still exists. Take EU as an example. The picture below shows EU’s investment for environmental protection from 2006 to 2019. Obviously, both government and corporation investment for EP displayed a decreasing trend during the period, which reflects that they care less and less on the environmental protection.

* However, the related impacts of climate changes are terrible and disastrous. The picture below shows that nearly 821 million undernourished partly due to drought, 35 million people affected by flood, 2 million people displaced by weather-linked disease, and the like. All these facts have demonstrated that environmental protection is indeed imminent and in great need.

* Admittedly, some countries have paid attention to environmental protection, such as France and Thailand. France is getting tough on vehicle emissions. High-polluting cars, such as SUVs, are now subject to higher levies. Until now, owners have had to pay an additional $14,000 on vehicles that breach emissions limits of 184g/km CO2. Moreover, France has banned a range of items made from single-use plastic, including plates, cups, and cotton buds, and drinks bottles when used in school canteens and catering services. Similarly, in Thailand, the use of three types of plastic – microbeads, cap seals and oxo-degradable plastics – will be banned by the end of 2020. But single country's efforts are not enough for the global environment.

* Research from the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that an estimated 4.2 to 7 million people die from air pollution worldwide every year and that nine out of 10 people breathe air that contains high levels of pollutants. In Africa, 258000 people died as a result of outdoor air pollution in 2017, up from 164000 in 1990, according to UNICEF. In Europe, a recent report from the EU’s environment agency showed that air pollution contributed to 400000 annual deaths in the EU in 2012. Besides air pollution, increased emissions of greenhouse gases have caused temperatures to rise. The climate crisis is warming the Arctic more than twice as fast as anywhere else on the planet. Seas are now rising an average of 3.2 mm per year globally, and are predicted to climb to a total of 0.2 to 2m by 2100. In the Arctic, the Greenland Ice Sheet poses the greatest risk for sea levels because melting land ice is the main cause of rising sea levels. These events and numbers constantly reminded the world that environmental protection requires more.

* In December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic was reported. Due to it, many people had to be cooped up at home for a long time. Factories temporarily closed. Countries all over the world had to press the pause button for their development. So people may assume that the global environment can get a break because of the outbreak.

* This topic will just focus on how the COVID-19 has affected the environment and predict the future environmental situation with these impacts. To be more specific, three key time points will first be selected to help analyze, which are the beginning of the pandemic, the stay-at-home decree issued, and the work resumption. Then, five countries will be chosen to represent five continents in the world. Air quality index, water quality index, and temperature or wind gust of weather will be taken as the factors to measure the environmental changes during the process of pandemic. In addition, environmental policies will also be included to see whether they adjusted after the outbreak.

* Questions shown below will be answered to help come to the final conclusions.

* Questions:

  *  How did the air quality change?  
  * Which air quality index varied widely?  
  * What types of activities were responsible for these indexes?  
  * How did the water quality change?  
  * Which water quality index varied widely?  
  * What types of activities were responsible for these indexes?  
  * How did the weather change?  
  * Why did the weather change so?  
  * What types of activities were responsible for these weather changes?  
  * Have the environmental protection policies of these five countries been affected by the epidemic and cannot be implemented?
  * Have these countries introduced new policies to protect the environment after the outbreak?
